# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
Become more familiar with deployment.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesis that people who have higher credit ratings, and income will be more likely to be granted a loan.

## EDA 
Missing values, bias towards men vs. women in data.


## Process
(fill in what you did during EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, testing)
### (your step 1)
Filled Na values, compared columns, created total income log column.
### (your step 2)
Used whole dataset for features, retro actively removing some.
### step 3
Created API and deployed model.
## Results/Demo

Roughly 70 % accurate on the first pass. Comparable between models.

## Challanges 
Creating model, API, and Flask were issues. Will require more time to be more comfortable.

## Future Goals
Change features, and make new ones based on previous columns. Remove features that
promote bias ie, Gender and Education.
